Babel has come a long way since Sebastian started the project only 3 years ago; it got renamed from 6to5 to Babel, has signficantly contributed to the use of ES2015+ by many companies, libraries, and developers alike. And now it's helping move the language forward by supporting the proposals coming from TC39.

We're really happy to see that the project itself has grown a lot since the [post from last year](https://babeljs.io/blog/2016/09/28/6.16.0):

- We've doubled the number of contributors to our main repository! +200 => +400
- We've more than doubled the amount of downloads of or main package (`babel-core`) in the last month (4.5 million -> 10.5 million)
- Moved from 4500 to over 7500 users on our [Slack community](https://babeljs.slack.com)
- There's been 44 releases since last year and 556 releases total.
- Almost 2000 community `babel-plugin`s [on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=babel-plugin)
- Over 1000 community `babel-preset`s [on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=babel-preset)

Thanks so much for using and contributing to our community!
